## 💡 Theory Behind the Tools

### Risk Calculator

The Risk Calculator uses a modified version of the **Kelly Criterion**, which is a risk management formula that helps determine the optimal amount of capital to risk on each trade. The formula considers factors like:

- Current profit or drawdown
- Risk preference (Conservative, Normal, Aggressive)
- Compound growth principles
- Maximum risk constraints

### Profit Simulator

The Profit Simulator helps you see the effects of different risk settings and trade outcomes over time, allowing you to optimize your strategies before live trading. It uses historical data and user-defined parameters to simulate realistic trading environments.

### Kelly Criterion

The Kelly Criterion is widely used in risk management for investments and trading. It aims to maximize the growth of capital while minimizing the risk of ruin. The formula is as follows:

```
Kelly % = W - [(1-W)/R]
```

Where:

- W = Winning probability
- R = Win/Loss ratio

### Compound Growth

The Risk Calculator applies the principles of compound growth to adjust risk based on your trading performance. During profitable periods, risk can be increased gradually, while it decreases during drawdowns, keeping your growth sustainable.
